            <Text>
              We envision a world where scientific knowledge is accessible to everyone, where researchers have full control over their work, 
              and where the scientific community collaboratively evaluates research based on merit rather than prestige.

              By leveraging blockchain technology and decentralized governance, we're creating a transparent, 
              equitable, and efficient ecosystem for scientific communication that serves the global community.

            <Text>
              Researka leverages blockchain technology to create a decentralized platform for academic publishing. 
              Our platform allows researchers to publish their work directly, retain ownership of their intellectual 
              property, and receive fair compensation for their contributions.
