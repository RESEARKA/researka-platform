# Researka Platform Accessibility Guidelines

This document outlines the accessibility standards and practices for the Researka platform to ensure it's usable by everyone, including people with disabilities.

## Accessibility Standards

The Researka platform aims to conform to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards. This includes:

1. **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
2. **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable.
3. **Understandable**: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.
4. **Robust**: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Semantic HTML

- Use appropriate HTML elements for their intended purpose
- Use heading levels (`h1`-`h6`) correctly and sequentially
- Use landmark elements (`main`, `nav`, `header`, `footer`, etc.)
- Use lists (`ul`, `ol`, `dl`) for list content

### Keyboard Accessibility

- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Maintain a logical tab order
- Provide visible focus indicators
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions

### Screen Reader Support

- Add appropriate ARIA attributes when necessary
- Ensure form elements have associated labels
- Provide descriptive alt text for images
- Use ARIA live regions for dynamic content

### Color and Contrast

- Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text
- Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 for large text
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Provide sufficient contrast for focus indicators

### Forms and Validation

- Associate labels with form controls
- Provide clear error messages
- Use fieldsets and legends for form groups
- Ensure form validation messages are accessible

### Responsive Design

- Ensure content is accessible at different viewport sizes
- Support text resizing up to 200% without loss of content
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44px Ã— 44px

## Testing Procedures

1. **Automated Testing**: Use tools like axe-core, Lighthouse, and WAVE
2. **Manual Testing**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader testing
3. **User Testing**: Include users with disabilities in testing
