# Test Fixtures

This directory contains test fixtures for document parsing plugins.

- `simple.txt`: A 10-line text file for basic parsing.
- `empty.txt`: A whitespace-only text file to test edge cases.
- `dummy.pages`: A placeholder for an Apple Pages file.
- Other files for PDF and DOCX will be added as binary or complex fixtures if possible.
