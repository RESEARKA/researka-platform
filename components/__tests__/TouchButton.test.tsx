   * stripped away, so querying by width/height or inner markup becomes brittle.
   *
   * Therefore we keep this unit test intentionally minimal: it verifies that
   * the component mounts without throwing. Behaviour-level checks (hover,
   * tap, focus states) live in Cypress E2E tests where a real browser can
   * evaluate the CSS.
