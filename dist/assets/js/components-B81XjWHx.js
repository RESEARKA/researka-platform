Models",abstract:"Recent advances in understanding epigenetic mechanisms have revealed their crucial role in neural stem cell fate determination. This study investigates how DNA methylation patterns and histone modifications influence neural stem cell differentiation in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative disorders.",fullText:"\nIntroduction:\nNeural stem cells (NSCs) represent a promising therapeutic avenue for neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The capacity of these cells to differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes makes them potential candidates for cell replacement strategies (Vishwakarma et al., 2023). However, the epigenetic mechanisms governing NSC differentiation in the context of AD pathology remain poorly understood. This study aims to elucidate how DNA methylation patterns and histone modifications influence neural stem cell fate in transgenic mouse models of AD.\n\nMethods:\nWe utilized APP/PS1 double transgenic mice expressing chimeric mouse/human amyloid precursor protein (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9). Neural stem cells were isolated from the subventricular zone of 6-month-old transgenic mice and age-matched wild-type controls (n=12 per group). Genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). Histone modifications, specifically H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H3K9ac, were analyzed using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). Differential methylation and histone modification patterns were correlated with gene expression profiles obtained through RNA sequencing.\n\nResults:\nOur analysis revealed significant alterations in DNA methylation patterns in NSCs from AD mice compared to controls. We identified 1,247 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), with 68% showing hypermethylation and 32% exhibiting hypomethylation. Notably, genes associated with neuronal differentiation, including NeuroD1, Neurog2, and Sox2, displayed aberrant methylation patterns in AD-derived NSCs. \n\nChIP-seq analysis demonstrated a global reduction in H3K9ac marks, suggesting decreased chromatin accessibility in AD-derived NSCs. Conversely, we observed an enrichment of repressive H3K27me3 marks at promoters of genes involved in neuronal differentiation and maturation. Integration of epigenetic data with transcriptome profiles revealed that these epigenetic alterations correlated with dysregulated expression of 342 genes involved in neurogenesis, axonal guidance, and synaptic plasticity.\n\nFunctional assays demonstrated that AD-derived NSCs exhibited impaired neuronal differentiation capacity, with a 47% reduction in βIII-tubulin-positive cells compared to controls. Pharmacological inhibition of DNA methyltransferases using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine partially rescued neuronal differentiation deficits, increasing the proportion of neurons by 31%.\n\nDiscussion:\nOur findings highlight the significant role of epigenetic dysregulation in compromising neural stem cell function in the context of Alzheimer's disease pathology. The observed hypermethylation of neurogenic genes, coupled with repressive histone modifications, creates an epigenetic landscape that impedes neuronal differentiation. These results align with previous studies suggesting that AD pathology creates a non-permissive environment for neurogenesis (Zhang et al., 2021).\n\nThe partial rescue of neuronal differentiation through DNMT inhibition suggests that targeting epigenetic mechanisms may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for enhancing endogenous repair in AD. However, the complex interplay between different epigenetic modifications necessitates a multifaceted approach to fully restore NSC functionality.\n\nConclusion:\nThis study provides novel insights into the epigenetic barriers that compromise neural stem cell function in Alzheimer's disease. Understanding these mechanisms may facilitate the development of epigenetic-based therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing endogenous neurogenesis or improving the efficacy of neural stem cell transplantation approaches for AD treatment.\n    ",authors:[{id:"auth-1001",name:"Dr. Eliza J.

Through comprehensive transcriptomic and functional analyses, we identified previously unrecognized pathways regulating epithelial barrier integrity, with implications for developing targeted therapies for inflammatory bowel disease.",fullText:"\nIntroduction:\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Genome-wide association studies have identified over 200 genetic loci associated with IBD susceptibility, yet the functional consequences of many of these genetic variants remain poorly understood (Khor et al., 2023). Recent advances in organoid technology and genome editing have created unprecedented opportunities to model complex diseases in physiologically relevant systems. This study leverages CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in human intestinal organoids to investigate the functional impact of IBD-associated genetic variants on epithelial barrier function.\n\nMethods:\nHuman intestinal organoids were established from biopsy samples of healthy donors (n=8) following informed consent. CRISPR-Cas9 was employed to introduce mutations in five IBD-associated genes: NOD2, ATG16L1, LRRK2, IRGM, and XBP1. Isogenic control and mutant organoids were subjected to comprehensive characterization, including RNA sequencing, barrier function assays, and immunofluorescence imaging. Barrier integrity was assessed using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran permeability assays and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements. To mimic inflammatory conditions, organoids were treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ) for 48 hours.\n\nResults:\nTranscriptomic analysis revealed distinct gene expression signatures associated with each genetic mutation. NOD2-deficient organoids exhibited downregulation of antimicrobial peptides, including defensins and REG3A, consistent with impaired bacterial sensing. ATG16L1 and IRGM mutant organoids displayed dysregulated autophagy pathways and enhanced endoplasmic reticulum stress responses. Notably, all mutant organoids showed alterations in genes involved in cell-cell adhesion and junction formation.\n\nFunctional assays demonstrated that LRRK2 and XBP1 mutant organoids exhibited significantly compromised barrier integrity under basal conditions, with a 2.8-fold and 3.2-fold increase in FITC-dextran permeability, respectively, compared to isogenic controls. Upon cytokine challenge, all mutant organoids displayed exacerbated barrier dysfunction compared to controls, with NOD2-deficient organoids showing the most severe disruption (4.7-fold increase in permeability).\n\nImmunofluorescence analysis revealed altered localization of tight junction proteins (claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1) in mutant organoids, particularly in LRRK2 and XBP1 mutants. Interestingly, we identified a previously unrecognized role for XBP1 in regulating the expression of CLDN2, which encodes the pore-forming tight junction protein claudin-2. XBP1-deficient organoids exhibited a 3.6-fold increase in CLDN2 expression, corresponding with enhanced paracellular permeability.\n\nDiscussion:\nOur findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which IBD-associated genetic variants compromise epithelial barrier function. The identification of XBP1 as a regulator of claudin-2 expression represents a previously unrecognized pathway linking endoplasmic reticulum stress to barrier dysfunction in IBD. This finding is particularly significant given that increased claudin-2 expression has been observed in the intestinal epithelium of IBD patients (Ahmad et al., 2022).\n\nThe distinct barrier phenotypes observed across different genetic backgrounds highlight the heterogeneity of IBD pathogenesis and underscore the potential for personalized therapeutic approaches. For instance, the pronounced barrier defects in XBP1 and LRRK2 mutant organoids suggest that patients carrying variants in these genes might benefit from therapies specifically targeting junction stability, while NOD2-deficient patients might require approaches that enhance antimicrobial defense.\n\nConclusion:\nThis study demonstrates the utility of CRISPR-engineered intestinal organoids for dissecting the functional consequences of IBD-associated genetic variants. By revealing gene-specific effects on epithelial barrier function, our findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of IBD pathogenesis and may guide the development of personalized therapeutic strategies. Future studies will explore how these genetic variants interact with environmental factors and the gut microbiome to influence disease susceptibility and progression.\n    ",authors:[{id:"auth-2001",name:"Dr. Miguel A.

Beneficial microbes can enhance nutrient acquisition, produce plant growth hormones, induce systemic resistance, and directly antagonize pathogens (Trivedi et al., 2022). While individual plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) have shown promise in laboratory settings, their effectiveness often diminishes under field conditions due to poor colonization, ecological instability, or inconsistent functionality across environments.\n\nSynthetic ecology—the design of artificial microbial communities with defined compositions and functions—offers a promising approach to overcome these limitations. By engineering compatible bacterial consortia with complementary functions and stable ecological interactions, it may be possible to create robust microbial inoculants with predictable benefits for plant hosts. This study reports the development of synthetic bacterial consortia engineered for programmable plant growth promotion and disease protection, with demonstrated efficacy in both controlled and field conditions.\n\nMethods:\nOur approach combined computational modeling, synthetic biology, and ecological engineering to design bacterial consortia with stable community dynamics and reliable plant-beneficial functions. We selected six bacterial strains (two Pseudomonas, two Bacillus, one Azotobacter, and one Streptomyces) based on their known plant-beneficial traits, genetic tractability, and predicted ecological compatibility.\n\nUsing genome-scale metabolic models and ecological interaction networks, we predicted optimal strain combinations and abundance ratios. These predictions were refined through iterative rounds of laboratory co-culture experiments and model updating. The final consortia design incorporated engineered dependencies through metabolic cross-feeding and quorum-sensing circuits to ensure stable community composition.\n\nEach strain was genetically modified to express specific plant-beneficial functions under appropriate environmental cues. These included phosphate solubilization (activated by root exudates), nitrogen fixation (regulated by oxygen levels), siderophore production (iron-dependent), antimicrobial compound synthesis (pathogen-induced), and phytohormone production (plant stress-responsive). Genetic circuits were designed using standardized synthetic biology parts and implemented using CRISPR-based genome editing.\n\nThe engineered consortia were evaluated in greenhouse experiments with Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants under various growth conditions and pathogen challenges. Field trials were conducted at three locations with different soil types and climatic conditions, using tomato and maize (Zea mays) as test crops. Plant growth parameters, yield, nutrient content, and disease incidence were assessed. Bacterial persistence and community composition were monitored using strain-specific quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing.\n\nResults:\nIn silico modeling accurately predicted stable community compositions, with experimental validation showing less than 15% deviation from predicted strain ratios after 30 days of plant colonization. The engineered metabolic dependencies and signaling circuits effectively maintained consortium stability, with all six strains remaining detectable throughout the experimental period in both greenhouse and field conditions.\n\nGreenhouse experiments demonstrated significant plant growth promotion by the synthetic consortia. Arabidopsis plants inoculated with the complete consortium showed 37% increased biomass, 42% higher phosphorus content, and 28% higher nitrogen content compared to uninoculated controls. Tomato plants exhibited similar improvements, with 31% increased shoot biomass and 45% increased fruit yield.\n\nThe disease-protective functions of the consortia were evaluated using Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 as a model pathogen for tomato. Plants inoculated with the synthetic consortia showed 73% reduction in disease severity compared to controls. Transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of salicylic acid and jasmonic acid-responsive defense genes in consortium-treated plants, indicating effective triggering of induced systemic resistance.\n\nField trials confirmed the greenhouse findings, with location-specific variations. Tomato yields increased by 22-35% across the three field sites, while maize showed 18-27% yield improvements. Disease incidence was reduced by 45-68% for bacterial speck in tomato and 38-52% for northern leaf blight in maize. Importantly, the engineered consortia maintained their designed strain ratios with less than 25% variation across all field sites, demonstrating robust ecological stability under diverse environmental conditions.\n\nDiscussion:\nThis study demonstrates the successful application of synthetic ecology principles to create bacterial consortia with programmable functions for plant growth promotion and disease protection. The integration of computational modeling, synthetic biology, and ecological engineering enabled the design of microbial communities with predictable behaviors and stable plant-beneficial functions across diverse environments.\n\nThe engineered ecological dependencies between consortium members proved effective in maintaining community stability, addressing a major limitation of previous microbial inoculants. By creating mutual benefits through metabolic cross-feeding and communication circuits, we ensured that selective pressures favored the maintenance of all consortium members at their designed ratios. This approach represents a significant advance over traditional single-strain inoculants or undefined mixed cultures.\n\nThe programmable nature of the consortia's beneficial functions represents another key innovation. By engineering genetic circuits that respond to specific environmental cues, we ensured that plant-beneficial traits were expressed when and where they were most needed, optimizing resource allocation and maximizing plant benefits. This context-dependent functionality likely contributed to the consistent performance observed across different environments.\n\nThe field trial results are particularly encouraging, demonstrating that the benefits observed in controlled settings can translate to real-world agricultural conditions. The significant yield improvements and disease protection across different crops and environments highlight the potential of engineered microbiomes as a sustainable approach to agricultural challenges.\n\nConclusion:\nThis study demonstrates that synthetic bacterial consortia with engineered ecological interactions and programmable functions can provide consistent plant growth promotion and disease protection across diverse environments. The successful field validation of these consortia represents a significant step toward practical applications of synthetic ecology in agriculture. Future work will focus on expanding the range of plant-beneficial functions, adapting the consortia for additional crop species, and developing formulations for commercial deployment. This approach offers a promising path toward reducing chemical inputs in agriculture while enhancing crop productivity and resilience.\n    ",authors:[{id:"auth-3001",name:"Dr. Priya Narasimhan",institution:"Department of Plant Sciences, University of California, Davis",email:"pnarasimhan@ucdavis.edu",orcid:"0000-0003-4219-7956"},{id:"auth-3002",name:"Prof. Eduardo Rocha",institution:"Microbial Evolutionary Genomics, Institut Pasteur",email:"eduardo.rocha@pasteur.fr",orcid:"0000-0001-7704-822X"},{id:"auth-3003",name:"Dr. Jillian Banfield",institution:"Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, University of California, Berkeley",email:"jbanfield@berkeley.edu",orcid:"0000-0001-8203-8771"}],publishedDate:"2025-01-28",category:"Biology",keywords:["synthetic ecology","plant microbiome","bacterial consortia","sustainable agriculture","plant growth promotion","disease resistance","synthetic biology"],citations:11,views:753,doi:"10.1038/s41587-025-0089-3"}],q=[{id:"chem-001",title:"Catalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Methanol Using Novel Metal-Organic Framework Composites",abstract:"The efficient conversion of carbon dioxide to value-added chemicals represents a promising approach to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions while producing useful feedstocks for the chemical industry.

Among various CO2 utilization strategies, the catalytic conversion of CO2 to methanol is particularly attractive as it produces a versatile liquid fuel and chemical feedstock while potentially contributing to a circular carbon economy (Li et al., 2023). However, the development of efficient catalysts for this transformation remains challenging due to the thermodynamic stability of CO2 and the multiple competing reaction pathways.\n\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with their high surface area, tunable pore structure, and diverse metal centers, offer promising platforms for designing heterogeneous catalysts with precisely controlled active sites. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of MOFs in CO2 reduction reactions, but challenges related to product selectivity, catalyst stability, and reaction efficiency under mild conditions persist.\n\nThis study reports the development of novel bimetallic MOF composites that effectively catalyze the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol with high selectivity and stability. Through systematic engineering of the MOF structure, metal centers, and functional groups, we achieved significant improvements in catalytic performance compared to conventional catalysts.\n\nMethods:\nWe synthesized a series of bimetallic MOF composites (M1-M2-MOF, where M1 = Cu, Ni, or Co and M2 = Ru, Pd, or Zn) using a one-pot hydrothermal method. The organic linkers were systematically varied to include carboxylate-based (BDC, BTC) and nitrogen-containing (BIM, DABCO) ligands. The resulting materials were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), nitrogen physisorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD).\n\nCatalytic performance was evaluated in a high-pressure batch reactor system. Typically, 100 mg of catalyst was dispersed in 50 mL of solvent (water, methanol, or their mixture), and the reactor was pressurized with CO2 (20-40 bar) and H2 (10-60 bar). Reactions were conducted at temperatures ranging from 100-180°C for 2-12 hours. Products were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Isotopic labeling experiments using 13CO2 were performed to elucidate reaction mechanisms.\n\nResults:\nAmong the various bimetallic MOF composites tested, Cu-Ru-BTC emerged as the most effective catalyst, achieving a methanol formation rate of 8.7 mmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹ at 150°C and 30 bar CO2/30 bar H2, with 87% selectivity toward methanol (the remaining products being primarily CO and formic acid). This performance represents a 3.2-fold improvement in activity and a 1.5-fold enhancement in selectivity compared to the benchmark Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 industrial catalyst tested under identical conditions.\n\nDetailed characterization revealed that the Cu-Ru-BTC catalyst features well-dispersed bimetallic nanoparticles (2-5 nm) embedded within the MOF structure. XPS analysis indicated the presence of partially reduced Cu⁺ species alongside metallic Cu⁰ and Ru⁰, with the Cu⁺/Cu⁰ ratio correlating positively with methanol selectivity. CO2-TPD measurements demonstrated strong CO2 adsorption on the catalyst surface, with multiple binding sites corresponding to different activation modes.\n\nThe incorporation of nitrogen-containing ligands in the MOF structure significantly enhanced catalyst performance. For instance, replacing BTC with BIM ligands in the Cu-Ru system increased the methanol formation rate by 35%, which we attribute to the improved stabilization of key reaction intermediates by the basic nitrogen sites. Similarly, introducing DABCO as a secondary ligand created hierarchical porosity in the MOF structure, improving mass transport properties and resulting in a 28% increase in catalytic activity.\n\nIsotopic labeling studies using 13CO2 confirmed that methanol formation proceeds primarily through a formate intermediate pathway. The rate-determining step was identified as the hydrogenation of formate species, based on kinetic isotope effect measurements using H2/D2. Interestingly, the bimetallic MOF catalysts exhibited significantly lower activation energy for this step (62 kJ/mol) compared to conventional Cu-based catalysts (89 kJ/mol), explaining their enhanced activity at lower temperatures.\n\nStability tests demonstrated that the Cu-Ru-BTC catalyst maintained over 90% of its initial activity after five consecutive reaction cycles (total TOS > 60 hours). Post-reaction characterization showed minimal changes in the MOF structure and metal nanoparticle size distribution, indicating excellent structural stability under reaction conditions. This stability is attributed to the strong metal-support interactions and the protective environment provided by the MOF framework.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe exceptional performance of our bimetallic MOF composites can be attributed to several synergistic factors. First, the bimetallic active sites facilitate the tandem activation of CO2 and H2, with Ru primarily responsible for H2 dissociation while Cu sites participate in CO2 activation and the subsequent hydrogenation steps. This cooperative effect is evidenced by the significantly higher activity of bimetallic catalysts compared to their monometallic counterparts.\n\nSecond, the MOF structure provides a well-defined environment for controlling the local coordination and electronic properties of the metal centers. The presence of oxygen and nitrogen donor atoms from the organic linkers modulates the electron density at the metal sites, favoring the formation and stabilization of key reaction intermediates. This is particularly important for stabilizing the formate intermediate and facilitating its subsequent hydrogenation to methanol.\n\nThird, the hierarchical pore structure of the optimized MOF composites enables efficient mass transport while maintaining high surface area and active site density. The combination of micropores (from the intrinsic MOF structure) and mesopores (created through ligand engineering) allows for rapid diffusion of reactants and products while providing confinement effects that enhance reaction selectivity.\n\nThe improved performance at lower temperatures (120-150°C vs. 220-300°C for conventional catalysts) is particularly significant from an energy efficiency perspective. The ability to operate under milder conditions not only reduces energy consumption but also minimizes side reactions and catalyst deactivation, contributing to the excellent stability observed in our systems.\n\nConclusion:\nThis study presents a series of novel MOF-based composite catalysts that demonstrate exceptional activity and selectivity for the conversion of CO2 to methanol under mild conditions. The rational design approach employed here, combining different metals and functional organic linkers, provides a versatile platform for developing efficient catalysts for CO2 utilization. These findings contribute to the ongoing efforts to develop sustainable technologies for mitigating carbon emissions while producing valuable chemical feedstocks.\n    ",authors:[{id:"auth-4001",name:"Dr. Yusuf Rahman",institution:"Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology",email:"yrahman@mit.edu",orcid:"0000-0002-1478-5209"},{id:"auth-4002",name:"Prof. Aisha Nakamura",institution:"Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences, Kyoto University",email:"a.nakamura@icems.kyoto-u.ac.jp",orcid:"0000-0003-4526-7120"},{id:"auth-4003",name:"Dr. Marcus Vetter",institution:"Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion",email:"m.vetter@cec.mpg.de",orcid:"0000-0001-9237-8124"}],publishedDate:"2025-02-18",category:"Chemistry",keywords:["carbon dioxide conversion","methanol synthesis","metal-organic frameworks","heterogeneous catalysis","bimetallic catalysts","CO2 utilization"],citations:7,views:612,doi:"10.1021/jacs.5b01234"},{id:"chem-002",title:"Total Synthesis of Marinomycin A via Biomimetic Macrocyclization",abstract:"Marinomycin A, a complex polyene macrodiolide natural product with promising antibiotic and anticancer properties, has remained a challenging synthetic target due to its intricate structure featuring a dimeric architecture and sensitive polyene system.

Marinomycin A, isolated from the marine actinomycete Marinispora CNQ-140, represents a particularly intriguing example, featuring a complex macrodiolide structure with promising antibiotic activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, as well as selective cytotoxicity against melanoma cell lines (Kwon et al., 2021).\n\nThe structural complexity of marinomycin A, characterized by a dimeric architecture containing two identical polyene-polyol monomeric units connected through a macrodiolide linkage, has made it a formidable synthetic challenge. Previous synthetic efforts have been hampered by the sensitivity of the conjugated polyene system to light, oxygen, and acidic conditions, as well as the difficulties associated with the stereoselective construction of the eight stereogenic centers present in each monomeric unit.\n\nThis paper reports the first enantioselective total synthesis of marinomycin A, employing a biomimetic approach that mimics the proposed biosynthetic pathway. Our strategy features a convergent assembly of the monomeric precursor followed by a late-stage dimerization and macrocyclization sequence, enabling efficient access to this structurally complex natural product.\n\nMethods:\nOur synthetic approach began with the development of a scalable route to the monomeric precursor of marinomycin A. The polyol segment containing five contiguous stereogenic centers was constructed using a catalytic asymmetric aldol methodology developed in our laboratory, employing a novel chiral copper(II) complex with a tridentate bis(oxazoline) ligand. This approach provided the required aldol adducts with excellent enantioselectivity (>95% ee) and diastereoselectivity (>20:1 dr).\n\nThe polyene segment was assembled through a sequence of stereoselective Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) olefinations using phosphonate reagents with modified reaction conditions to ensure high E-selectivity. A critical aspect of our approach was the development of conditions that minimized isomerization of the sensitive polyene system. This was achieved through the use of mild reaction conditions (KHMDS, 18-crown-6, -78°C) and the rigorous exclusion of light and oxygen throughout the synthetic sequence.\n\nThe coupling of the polyol and polyene segments was accomplished through a stereoselective aldol reaction, followed by careful functional group manipulations to install the requisite carboxylic acid and alcohol functionalities needed for the subsequent macrocyclization. Extensive optimization was required to identify conditions that would preserve the integrity of the polyene system during these transformations.\n\nFor the key dimerization and macrocyclization sequence, we explored various strategies including double esterification approaches and sequential esterification-macrolactonization pathways. After extensive experimentation, we identified a modified Shiina protocol using 2-methyl-6-nitrobenzoic anhydride (MNBA) with DMAP in highly diluted dichloromethane as optimal for achieving the desired transformation in a single operation. This approach provided the protected marinomycin A in 32% yield, which was subsequently deprotected using HF·pyridine complex to afford the natural product.\n\nThroughout the synthesis, specialized handling techniques were employed to minimize degradation of the light and oxygen-sensitive intermediates. These included the use of amber glassware, low-temperature storage, and the addition of BHT as a radical scavenger in all chromatographic purifications.\n\nResults:\nThe synthesis of the monomeric precursor was accomplished in 18 steps from commercially available starting materials, with an overall yield of 7.2%. The stereoselective construction of the polyene system was achieved with excellent E/Z selectivity (>20:1) using our modified HWE reaction conditions. The eight stereogenic centers were established with high enantioselectivity (>95% ee for each center) as confirmed by chiral HPLC analysis of key intermediates.\n\nThe critical dimerization and macrocyclization sequence was successfully executed using modified Shiina conditions (2-methyl-6-nitrobenzoic anhydride, DMAP, triethylamine) in highly diluted dichloromethane (0.5 mM) at 0°C, affording the protected marinomycin A in 32% yield. Global deprotection using HF·pyridine complex provided the target natural product in 85% yield for this final step.\n\nSpectroscopic data (1H and 13C NMR, HRMS, IR, and optical rotation) of the synthetic marinomycin A were in excellent agreement with those reported for the natural product, confirming the structural assignment. X-ray crystallographic analysis of a p-bromobenzoate derivative of a key intermediate confirmed the absolute configuration of the stereogenic centers.\n\nBiological evaluation of the synthetic material demonstrated antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities identical to those reported for the natural product. Notably, our synthetic marinomycin A exhibited potent activity against MRSA (MIC = 0.13 μg/mL) and melanoma cell lines (IC50 = 0.4-0.9 μM against several melanoma lines), with significantly lower cytotoxicity against non-transformed cells.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe successful total synthesis of marinomycin A represents a significant achievement in complex natural product synthesis, overcoming numerous challenges associated with the construction of the sensitive polyene system and the intricate macrodiolide architecture. Our biomimetic approach, featuring a late-stage dimerization and macrocyclization, proved highly effective for accessing this complex natural product.\n\nSeveral aspects of our synthetic strategy merit further discussion. First, the development of highly stereoselective methods for constructing the polyol and polyene segments was crucial for the success of the synthesis. The catalytic asymmetric aldol methodology developed in our laboratory provided an efficient means of establishing the required stereochemistry in the polyol segment, while our modified HWE olefination conditions enabled the stereoselective construction of the sensitive polyene system.\n\nSecond, the successful execution of the key dimerization and macrocyclization sequence demonstrates the viability of biomimetic approaches for constructing complex natural product architectures. The efficiency of this transformation (32% yield for the formation of two ester bonds and a 38-membered macrocycle) is particularly noteworthy given the complexity of the system.\n\nThird, the development of specialized handling techniques for managing the light and oxygen sensitivity of the polyene intermediates was essential for the success of the synthesis. These approaches may find broader application in the synthesis of other sensitive polyene natural products.\n\nFrom a biological perspective, the availability of synthetic marinomycin A opens new opportunities for exploring the therapeutic potential of this promising natural product. The demonstrated activity against MRSA and melanoma cell lines, coupled with the relatively low cytotoxicity against non-transformed cells, suggests that marinomycin A may serve as a valuable lead compound for the development of new antibiotics and anticancer agents.\n\nConclusion:\nWe have developed the first enantioselective total synthesis of marinomycin A, employing a novel biomimetic macrocyclization strategy. Our approach features a key late-stage dimerization of monomeric precursors, enabling efficient access to this structurally complex natural product. The synthetic material exhibited biological activities identical to those of the natural product, confirming both the structural assignment and the potential of marinomycin A as a lead compound for antibiotic and anticancer drug development.

Biodegradable polyesters represent a promising class of materials that can address these concerns, provided they can be produced from abundant non-food biomass using environmentally benign processes (Zhu et al., 2023).\n\nLignocellulosic biomass, comprising cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, represents the most abundant renewable carbon source on Earth. However, its recalcitrant structure presents significant challenges for conversion into value-added products. Traditional biomass processing methods often involve harsh conditions and environmentally problematic chemicals, undermining the sustainability benefits of the resulting materials.\n\nThis study reports the development of an integrated process for converting lignocellulosic biomass into biodegradable polyesters, combining the advantages of ionic liquid pretreatment, selective oxidative depolymerization, and enzymatic polymerization. This approach enables the production of polyesters with tunable properties while adhering to green chemistry principles and maintaining a favorable environmental footprint.\n\nMethods:\nOur process began with the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass (corn stover, switchgrass, and pine sawdust) using the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM][OAc]). This step was conducted at 120°C for 3 hours with 10% biomass loading, resulting in the dissolution of cellulose and hemicellulose while precipitating lignin. The fractionated components were recovered through selective precipitation using antisolvents (water for lignin, ethanol for cellulose).\n\nThe cellulose and hemicellulose fractions were subjected to oxidative depolymerization using a catalytic system comprising 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) and sodium hypochlorite, with sodium bromide as a co-catalyst. This reaction was performed under mild conditions (pH 10, 25°C) to produce dicarboxylic acids of varying chain lengths (C2-C6). The product distribution was controlled by adjusting reaction parameters, particularly the oxidant concentration and reaction time.\n\nThe lignin fraction was valorized through a base-catalyzed depolymerization process using NaOH in supercritical methanol (280°C, 30 min), yielding aromatic monomers including vanillic acid, syringic acid, and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. These aromatic building blocks were incorporated as comonomers in subsequent polymerization reactions to enhance the mechanical properties of the resulting polymers.\n\nEnzymatic polymerization was performed using immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) as a catalyst, with the dicarboxylic acids and bio-based diols (1,3-propanediol and 1,4-butanediol produced from glycerol and succinic acid, respectively) as monomers. Polymerizations were conducted in diphenyl ether at 70°C under vacuum (10 mbar) to remove the water byproduct and drive the reaction to high conversion. Various polymer compositions were prepared by adjusting the monomer ratios and incorporating the lignin-derived aromatic comonomers.\n\nThe resulting polyesters were characterized using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and mechanical testing. Biodegradability was assessed through soil burial tests and enzymatic degradation assays using lipases. The environmental impact of the entire process was evaluated using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology.\n\nResults:\nThe fractionation of lignocellulosic biomass using [EMIM][OAc] achieved high dissolution efficiency, with 85-92% of cellulose and 78-83% of hemicellulose recovered in the soluble fraction. The oxidative depolymerization process converted these carbohydrates into dicarboxylic acids with yields of 62-68% based on the carbohydrate content of the original biomass.\n\nThe enzymatic polymerization of the bio-based monomers proceeded with high efficiency, achieving number-average molecular weights (Mn) of 25,000-45,000 g/mol depending on the monomer composition. The polyesters exhibited glass transition temperatures (Tg) ranging from -25°C to 15°C and melting temperatures (Tm) between 45°C and 120°C, with crystallinity varying from 15% to 45%. Incorporation of the lignin-derived aromatic comonomers (5-15 mol%) increased the Tg and tensile strength while reducing crystallinity.\n\nMechanical properties of the polyesters were tunable based on composition, with tensile strengths ranging from 10 to 35 MPa, elongation at break from 150% to 400%, and Young's moduli from 150 to 500 MPa. These properties are comparable to those of commercial biodegradable polyesters such as poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) and certain grades of poly(lactic acid) (PLA).\n\nBiodegradability testing demonstrated complete degradation of the polyesters in soil within 3-6 months, with degradation rates influenced by crystallinity and aromatic content. Enzymatic degradation studies showed that lipases effectively catalyzed the hydrolysis of the ester bonds, with degradation rates correlating inversely with crystallinity and the content of aromatic comonomers.\n\nLife cycle assessment revealed significant environmental benefits compared to petroleum-based polymers. The biomass-derived polyesters showed 60-75% lower greenhouse gas emissions, 40-55% reduction in non-renewable energy use, and 45-60% decrease in ecotoxicity impacts compared to polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The use of ionic liquids contributed significantly to the environmental impact, but this was partially offset by the high efficiency of the process and the potential for ionic liquid recycling (demonstrated for up to 5 cycles with minimal loss of efficiency).\n\nDiscussion:\nThe integrated process developed in this study addresses several key challenges in the sustainable production of biodegradable polymers from lignocellulosic biomass. The ionic liquid pretreatment enables efficient fractionation of biomass components under relatively mild conditions, avoiding the harsh acids or bases typically used in conventional processes. This approach not only improves the efficiency of subsequent conversion steps but also enables the valorization of all major biomass components.\n\nThe oxidative depolymerization strategy provides a direct route from carbohydrates to dicarboxylic acid monomers, bypassing the need for fermentation or other biological processes that often suffer from low yields and product inhibition. The mild conditions employed (ambient temperature, aqueous medium) align with green chemistry principles and minimize energy requirements.\n\nThe enzymatic polymerization represents a particularly sustainable approach to polymer synthesis, operating under mild conditions with high catalytic efficiency and specificity. The absence of metal catalysts, toxic solvents, or harsh reagents enhances the environmental credentials of the process and simplifies downstream purification. The ability to produce polyesters with molecular weights comparable to those of commercial polymers demonstrates the viability of this approach for practical applications.\n\nThe tunable properties of the resulting polyesters, achieved through variation in monomer composition and incorporation of lignin-derived aromatics, enable the tailoring of materials for specific applications. This versatility is crucial for the development of bio-based alternatives that can match the performance of conventional plastics across diverse use cases.\n\nThe demonstrated biodegradability of the polyesters addresses the end-of-life challenges associated with conventional plastics. The correlation between structure and degradation rate provides a basis for designing materials with predetermined lifespans, balancing durability during use with degradability after disposal.\n\nThe favorable life cycle assessment results confirm the environmental benefits of the developed process, though they also highlight the importance of ionic liquid recycling for minimizing the overall impact. The potential for further optimization, particularly in terms of process integration and energy efficiency, suggests that additional environmental improvements are achievable.\n\nConclusion:\nThis study demonstrates a sustainable approach to converting lignocellulosic biomass into biodegradable polyesters with tunable properties. By integrating ionic liquid pretreatment, selective oxidative depolymerization, and enzymatic polymerization, we have developed a process that adheres to green chemistry principles while producing materials with performance comparable to conventional plastics. The demonstrated biodegradability and favorable life cycle assessment results highlight the potential of this approach for addressing the environmental challenges associated with plastic production and waste management.

Citizen science—the involvement of volunteers in scientific research—has emerged as a powerful approach to expand the scope and impact of biodiversity monitoring and conservation efforts (Bonney et al., 2022). While citizen science has historical roots dating back centuries, recent technological advances and growing environmental awareness have catalyzed unprecedented growth in public participation in biodiversity research.\n\nThis review synthesizes findings from a comprehensive analysis of 250 biodiversity-focused citizen science initiatives across six continents, examining their scientific contributions, conservation impacts, and operational best practices.

Taxonomically, birds remain the most monitored group (42% of projects), but initiatives focusing on invertebrates, plants, and fungi have shown the fastest growth (annual increases of 18%, 15%, and 12%, respectively).\n\nData quality analysis demonstrated that properly designed citizen science projects can produce data of comparable accuracy to professional studies. Projects employing structured protocols with built-in validation mechanisms achieved species identification accuracy rates of 88-97% depending on taxonomic group. Statistical power analyses indicated that the expanded spatial and temporal coverage of citizen science data often compensated for higher variability, resulting in enhanced ability to detect population trends and range shifts.\n\nScientific impact has been substantial, with citizen science data contributing to 1,843 peer-reviewed publications over the past decade. Projects integrated with professional research programs and explicit scientific objectives produced significantly more publications (p<0.001). Notably, citizen science has enabled discoveries of 372 species new to science and documented 4,125 significant range extensions, particularly in regions with limited professional scientific capacity.\n\nConservation impact was evidenced by the incorporation of citizen science data into 213 species management plans, 97 protected area designations or expansions, and 145 national biodiversity strategies. Projects that actively engaged with policymakers and conservation practitioners from the design phase showed significantly higher policy uptake (p<0.01).\n\nParticipant engagement analysis identified several success factors, including clear communication of project goals, user-friendly data collection tools, regular feedback on contributions, recognition of participant achievements, and opportunities for social interaction. Projects offering tiered participation options, allowing contributors to increase their involvement as they gained experience, achieved 68% higher retention rates than those with fixed participation structures.\n\nDiscussion:\nOur findings demonstrate that citizen science has evolved from a supplementary data collection approach to a transformative force in biodiversity research and conservation. The scale and scope of data generated through public participation have enabled analyses that would be logistically impossible through traditional scientific approaches alone. Moreover, the geographic and temporal coverage achieved by citizen science networks has proven invaluable for tracking biodiversity responses to global change.\n\nThe scientific credibility of citizen science has substantially increased through methodological innovations in project design and data validation. The development of standardized protocols, technological tools for real-time validation, expert review systems, and statistical methods for accounting for observer variation has addressed many historical concerns about data quality. Our finding that well-designed citizen science projects can produce data of comparable quality to professional studies challenges persistent skepticism and supports the integration of citizen-generated data into mainstream scientific analyses.\n\nBeyond data generation, citizen science has created novel pathways for public engagement with biodiversity conservation. The documented increases in participants' knowledge, concern, and pro-environmental behaviors suggest that the educational and social outcomes of citizen science may be as valuable as the scientific contributions. This dual benefit—advancing scientific knowledge while fostering environmental stewardship—positions citizen science as a particularly effective approach in the context of accelerating biodiversity loss.\n\nThe policy and management applications of citizen science data highlight the practical conservation value of these initiatives. The responsive nature of citizen science networks, which can rapidly mobilize observers across broad geographic areas, has proven especially valuable for early detection of invasive species, monitoring of threatened populations, and documenting responses to environmental changes or management interventions.\n\nHowever, our analysis also identified significant challenges and opportunities for improvement. Many projects struggle with sustainable funding models, as the costs of coordination, data management, and participant support are often underestimated. Additionally, there remains a geographic bias in citizen science implementation, with fewer initiatives in biodiversity-rich but economically disadvantaged regions. Addressing these challenges will require innovative funding approaches, international partnerships, and capacity building efforts.\n\nConclusion:\nCitizen science has emerged as a powerful approach for advancing biodiversity monitoring and conservation, generating data at unprecedented scales while fostering public engagement with environmental stewardship. The success factors identified in this review—standardized protocols, robust validation, clear communication, user-friendly tools, and strategic partnerships—provide a framework for designing high-impact initiatives. As biodiversity faces mounting pressures from habitat loss, climate change, and other anthropogenic threats, citizen science offers a scalable, cost-effective mechanism for tracking ecosystem health and informing conservation actions. By harnessing the collective potential of public participation, the scientific community can significantly enhance its capacity to document, understand, and protect global biodiversity.\n    ",authors:[{id:"auth-7001",name:"Dr. Isabella J.

As society grapples with complex challenges from climate change to public health emergencies, the need for effective translation of scientific knowledge into public understanding has never been more urgent (Davies et al., 2023). Yet despite growing recognition of its importance, science communication often remains fragmented across disciplinary boundaries, with limited integration of insights from relevant fields.\n\nThis paper presents an interdisciplinary framework for science communication that synthesizes perspectives from four domains: journalism (focusing on information gathering, verification, and storytelling), psychology (examining information processing, belief formation, and behavior change), design (addressing visual representation, information architecture, and user experience), and digital media studies (exploring platform dynamics, interactivity, and networked communication). By integrating these perspectives, we aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence science communication effectiveness across diverse contexts and audiences.\n\nOur analysis draws on a systematic examination of 150 science communication initiatives spanning multiple scientific domains, communication channels, and target audiences. Through this analysis, we identify key principles and practices that enhance engagement, comprehension, and knowledge transfer in science communication. We also explore how these principles can be applied to address contemporary challenges in the science-society interface, including misinformation, polarization, and declining trust in expertise.\n\nMethods:\nWe employed a mixed-methods approach to develop and validate our interdisciplinary framework. First, we conducted a systematic literature review across the four contributing domains (journalism, psychology, design, and digital media studies), identifying theoretical frameworks and empirical findings relevant to science communication. This review yielded an initial set of principles and practices hypothesized to enhance communication effectiveness.\n\nNext, we analyzed 150 science communication initiatives selected to represent diversity in scientific domain (physical sciences, life sciences, social sciences, and interdisciplinary topics), communication channel (print, digital, broadcast, and in-person), target audience (general public, policymakers, students, and specific interest communities), and organizational context (academic institutions, media organizations, government agencies, and non-profit organizations). For each initiative, we collected data on design features, audience engagement metrics, knowledge transfer outcomes, and contextual factors.\n\nData collection methods included content analysis of communication materials, semi-structured interviews with creators and audience members (n=75), analysis of engagement metrics where available, and pre-post assessments of knowledge and attitudes for a subset of initiatives (n=42). We also conducted four in-depth case studies of particularly successful initiatives to provide richer contextual understanding of effective approaches.\n\nData analysis employed both quantitative techniques (statistical analysis of engagement metrics and knowledge assessments) and qualitative approaches (thematic analysis of interviews and communication materials). Through iterative analysis and synthesis, we identified recurring patterns and principles that appeared to enhance communication effectiveness across diverse contexts.\n\nResults:\nOur analysis revealed that science communication initiatives employing strong interdisciplinary approaches achieved significantly higher engagement metrics and knowledge transfer outcomes compared to those relying predominantly on single-discipline frameworks. Specifically, initiatives integrating elements from all four domains demonstrated 47% higher completion rates, 68% greater information retention, and 52% more sharing behaviors than those employing one or two domains.\n\nNarrative techniques emerged as particularly powerful tools for science communication, with story-driven explanations generating 2.3 times higher engagement than fact-based presentations of equivalent information. However, the effectiveness of narrative approaches varied by topic and audience segment. For controversial issues like genetic engineering and climate change, narratives featuring diverse perspectives and explicit acknowledgment of uncertainties generated more sustained engagement and nuanced understanding than advocacy-oriented storytelling.\n\nVisual communication strategies demonstrated strong effectiveness across all audience segments, with interactive visualizations producing the highest knowledge gains for complex topics. Notably, visualizations that allowed users to manipulate variables and observe outcomes (e.g., climate model simulations, epidemic spread visualizations) led to more accurate mental models of scientific processes than static representations.\n\nAudience-specific framing emerged as a critical factor in communication effectiveness. Initiatives that conducted formative research to understand audience values, mental models, and information needs before developing content showed 73% higher engagement than those using generic approaches. However, we found that only 28% of the analyzed initiatives reported conducting systematic audience research during the design phase.\n\nDigital interaction features significantly enhanced engagement and knowledge transfer, particularly for younger audiences. Science communication initiatives incorporating elements such as quizzes, decision scenarios, and user-contributed content achieved 84% higher completion rates and 62% greater information retention compared to passive consumption formats. However, the effectiveness of these features depended on thoughtful integration with content rather than superficial gamification.\n\nInstitutional context and perceived source credibility strongly influenced audience receptivity to science communication. Initiatives that transparently communicated their methodological approach, acknowledged limitations, and clearly distinguished between established findings and emerging research generated higher trust ratings. Collaborative initiatives involving multiple institutions (e.g., academic-journalistic partnerships) showed particular promise for reaching diverse audiences.\n\nDiscussion:\nOur findings demonstrate that effective science communication requires integration across traditionally separate domains of expertise. The journalistic emphasis on narrative and verification, the psychological understanding of information processing and persuasion, the design focus on visual representation and user experience, and the digital media perspective on interactivity and networked communication each contribute essential elements to successful science communication. Initiatives that thoughtfully integrate these perspectives achieve substantially better outcomes than those operating primarily within single disciplinary frameworks.\n\nThe power of narrative approaches highlighted in our analysis aligns with growing evidence that human cognition is fundamentally story-oriented. However, our findings suggest that the specific narrative structures most effective for science communication differ from conventional journalistic or entertainment storytelling. Effective science narratives maintain fidelity to evidence while employing techniques such as analogies, character-driven examples, and explanatory sequences that build conceptual understanding. The variation in narrative effectiveness across topics and audiences underscores the importance of tailoring approaches to specific communication contexts rather than applying generic templates.\n\nThe strong performance of interactive visualizations reflects the cognitive benefits of multimodal learning and active engagement with complex information. By enabling audiences to explore relationships between variables and observe the consequences of different scenarios, these approaches support development of accurate mental models that can be applied beyond the specific examples presented. The growing accessibility of tools for creating interactive visualizations represents a significant opportunity for enhancing science communication across diverse topics and settings.\n\nOur findings regarding audience-specific framing highlight both an opportunity and a persistent challenge in science communication. While tailoring communication to audience characteristics demonstrably enhances effectiveness, many science communication initiatives continue to employ one-size-fits-all approaches or rely on intuitive rather than evidence-based assumptions about audience needs. Developing more systematic approaches to audience research and segmentation represents a critical priority for advancing science communication practice.\n\nThe influence of institutional context and source credibility on communication effectiveness underscores the importance of addressing structural factors alongside message-level considerations. In an era of declining trust in traditional institutions, science communication initiatives must navigate complex questions of authority, transparency, and perceived objectivity. Our findings suggest that collaborative approaches involving multiple types of institutions may help bridge credibility gaps and reach diverse audiences, though such collaborations require careful attention to potential tensions between different institutional norms and priorities.\n\nConclusion:\nInterdisciplinary approaches combining journalism, psychology, design, and digital media offer powerful frameworks for science communication in an increasingly complex information landscape. By strategically integrating these perspectives, communicators can create experiences that are simultaneously engaging, comprehensible, and scientifically accurate. However, realizing this potential requires institutional structures that facilitate genuine collaboration across traditionally separate domains, as well as evaluation frameworks that capture the multidimensional nature of communication effectiveness. As scientific issues become increasingly central to public discourse and policy decisions, investing in these interdisciplinary approaches represents a critical priority for scientific institutions, media organizations, and funding agencies committed to fostering an informed and engaged public.\n    ",authors:[{id:"auth-8001",name:"Dr. Jonathan P.

As renewable sources like solar and wind power increasingly form the backbone of electricity systems worldwide, their inherent variability and decentralized nature create new challenges for system planning, operation, and optimization. Concurrently, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has opened new possibilities for addressing these challenges through enhanced forecasting, control, and decision-making capabilities (Rolnick et al., 2022).\n\nThis review examines the convergence of AI and renewable energy technologies, providing a comprehensive assessment of current applications, implementation challenges, and future research directions. We analyze how machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and other AI approaches are being applied across the renewable energy value chain—from resource assessment and forecasting to system operation, grid integration, and materials discovery. By synthesizing insights from both academic research and commercial implementations, we aim to provide a balanced perspective on the state of the field and its potential trajectory.\n\nOur analysis is based on a systematic review of over 500 research publications spanning the past decade, complemented by case studies of 50 commercial AI implementations in renewable energy contexts. We evaluate the technological maturity, demonstrated benefits, and implementation challenges of different application areas, with particular attention to the scalability and generalizability of proposed approaches. Additionally, we identify critical gaps in current research and practice, highlighting promising directions for future work.\n\nMethods:\nOur methodological approach combined systematic literature review, case study analysis, and expert consultation. For the literature review, we searched major scientific databases using a structured query combining terms related to artificial intelligence (e.g., "machine learning," "deep learning," "computer vision") and renewable energy (e.g., "solar power," "wind energy," "smart grid"). After screening for relevance and quality, 537 publications from 2015-2025 were included in the final analysis.\n\nPublications were categorized according to AI approach, renewable energy technology, application area, and level of technological maturity (using the technology readiness level framework). We conducted quantitative analysis of publication trends and citation patterns, complemented by qualitative content analysis to identify key themes, methodological approaches, and reported outcomes.\n\nTo complement the academic literature, we analyzed 50 case studies of commercial AI implementations in renewable energy contexts. Case studies were selected to represent diversity in geographic location, organization type, renewable technology, and application area. Data sources included company reports, technical documentation, industry analyses, and interviews with implementation teams where possible. Each case study was evaluated using a structured framework addressing technological approach, implementation challenges, measured outcomes, and lessons learned.\n\nFinally, we conducted consultations with 25 experts spanning academia, industry, and policy domains to validate our findings and identify emerging trends not yet well-represented in the literature. Expert input was particularly valuable for assessing implementation challenges and future research directions.\n\nResults:\nOur analysis revealed widespread and rapidly growing implementation of AI across the renewable energy value chain, with varying levels of technological maturity and impact. Resource forecasting emerged as the most mature application area, with deep learning approaches demonstrating significant improvements in prediction accuracy for solar irradiance (15-25% error reduction) and wind power (18-30% error reduction) compared to conventional statistical methods. Notably, hybrid models combining physics-based simulations with neural networks showed superior performance in complex terrain and extreme weather conditions.\n\nIn system operation and maintenance, machine learning-based predictive maintenance has progressed from research to commercial deployment, particularly in wind energy. Computer vision algorithms analyzing drone imagery have achieved 92-97% accuracy in detecting solar panel defects and wind turbine blade damage, enabling condition-based maintenance strategies that reduce downtime by 23-35% and maintenance costs by 18-27% in documented implementations.\n\nGrid integration applications have focused on addressing the variability and uncertainty of renewable generation. Reinforcement learning algorithms for battery storage dispatch have demonstrated 12-18% improvements in economic performance compared to rule-based approaches, while maintaining grid stability constraints. Virtual power plant orchestration using multi-agent systems has enabled aggregation of distributed energy resources, with field trials showing 8-14% improvements in revenue and 10-20% reductions in balancing costs.\n\nMaterials discovery represents an emerging frontier, with machine learning accelerating the identification and optimization of novel materials for solar cells, batteries, and electrolyzers. High-throughput computational screening combined with active learning has reduced experimental iterations required for materials development by 60-80% in research settings, though commercial implementation remains limited.\n\nDespite these promising results, our analysis identified several persistent challenges. Data quality and availability emerged as critical limitations, particularly for smaller renewable energy systems and in regions with limited monitoring infrastructure. The lack of standardized data formats and sharing protocols further hinders development of generalizable AI solutions. Additionally, many AI approaches demonstrated in research contexts face significant implementation barriers related to computational requirements, integration with existing systems, and workforce capabilities.\n\nInstitutional and regulatory factors also influence AI adoption. Our case studies revealed that organizations with clear data governance frameworks, cross-functional implementation teams, and executive-level support achieved more successful outcomes. Regulatory uncertainty regarding data ownership, algorithm transparency, and system reliability requirements was frequently cited as a barrier to wider implementation, particularly for grid integration applications.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe convergence of AI and renewable energy technologies presents significant opportunities for accelerating the clean energy transition. Our findings demonstrate that AI applications have matured beyond proof-of-concept to deliver measurable improvements in system performance, cost-effectiveness, and reliability across multiple domains. The progression from relatively simple forecasting applications to more complex control and optimization functions reflects both technological advancement and growing confidence in AI-based approaches.\n\nSeveral trends emerge from our analysis that may shape future developments. First, we observe a shift from purely data-driven approaches toward hybrid models that integrate domain knowledge and physical principles with machine learning techniques. These physics-informed AI approaches address limitations of purely statistical methods, particularly for complex systems with limited historical data or under novel conditions not represented in training datasets.\n\nSecond, the evolution toward distributed, edge-computing implementations of AI algorithms reflects the increasingly decentralized nature of renewable energy systems. By processing data closer to its source, these approaches reduce latency, communication bandwidth requirements, and privacy concerns, enabling more responsive control of distributed energy resources.\n\nThird, the growing emphasis on explainable AI addresses critical concerns regarding transparency and trustworthiness, particularly for applications affecting grid reliability or energy market operations. Techniques that provide insight into algorithm decision-making not only facilitate regulatory compliance but also build operator confidence and enable effective human-AI collaboration.\n\nDespite these positive trends, significant challenges remain in translating research advances into widespread implementation. The "valley of death" between academic demonstration and commercial deployment appears particularly wide for more complex applications like grid integration and virtual power plant orchestration. Bridging this gap will require not only technical advances but also business model innovation, workforce development, and supportive regulatory frameworks.\n\nThe interdisciplinary nature of this field presents both challenges and opportunities. Effective implementation requires collaboration between data scientists, domain experts, system operators, and policy makers—groups with different priorities, vocabularies, and working methods. Organizations that have established effective cross-functional teams report more successful outcomes, suggesting that human and organizational factors may be as important as technical considerations in determining implementation success.\n\nConclusion:\nThe convergence of AI and renewable energy represents a promising frontier for addressing climate and energy challenges. Our review demonstrates that AI applications have progressed beyond theoretical research to deliver tangible improvements in renewable energy forecasting, operation, integration, and development. As these technologies continue to mature, interdisciplinary collaboration between energy domain experts and AI researchers will be essential to address implementation challenges and realize the full potential of this technological convergence. Strategic research investments in physics-informed AI, explainable algorithms, and standardized evaluation frameworks will accelerate progress toward a more efficient, reliable, and sustainable energy system.\n    ',authors:[{id:"auth-9001",name:"Dr. Michael Chen",institution:"Energy Systems Laboratory, Stanford University",email:"michael.chen@stanford.edu",orcid:"0000-0002-4571-8532"},{id:"auth-9002",name:"Prof. Amara Wilson",institution:"School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University",email:"a.wilson@cornell.edu",orcid:"0000-0001-9237-4526"},{id:"auth-9003",name:"Dr. Fatima Al-Zahrani",institution:"Renewable Energy Research Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology",email:"fatima.alzahrani@kaust.edu.sa",orcid:"0000-0003-6158-7403"}],publishedDate:"2025-03-07",category:"General Science",keywords:["artificial intelligence","renewable energy","machine learning","predictive maintenance","energy forecasting","smart grid","materials discovery"],citations:4,views:578,doi:"10.1038/s41560-025-01142-x"}],F=[{id:"phys-001",title:"Quantum Coherence in Macroscopic Systems: Experimental Observations and Theoretical Implications",abstract:"This study reports the observation of quantum coherence effects in macroscopic systems at unprecedented scales.

Quantum mechanics, with its principles of superposition and entanglement, has been extraordinarily successful in describing microscopic systems. However, the apparent absence of quantum effects in everyday macroscopic objects has led to the development of various theoretical frameworks to explain this quantum-to-classical transition, including decoherence theory, objective collapse models, and gravitational effects on quantum systems (Bassi et al., 2022).\n\nRecent experimental advances have progressively pushed the size limit of systems exhibiting quantum behavior, from atoms and molecules to increasingly larger objects such as nanomechanical oscillators and superconducting circuits. These experiments have not only tested the limits of quantum mechanics but also opened new possibilities for quantum technologies. This study reports a significant advancement in this progression, demonstrating quantum coherence in systems containing approximately 10^18 atoms—an order of magnitude larger than previous experiments.\n\nMethods:\nOur experimental approach combines elements from superconducting quantum circuits and optomechanical systems. The core of the apparatus consists of a superconducting aluminum membrane (4.2 mm × 4.2 mm × 25 nm) coupled to both a microwave resonator and an optical cavity. This hybrid architecture allows us to leverage the precise control capabilities of superconducting circuits while enabling optical readout with quantum-limited precision.\n\nThe membrane was cooled to 15 mK in a dilution refrigerator with extensive electromagnetic and vibrational isolation. Quantum state preparation utilized a modified version of the protocol developed by O'Connell et al., adapted for significantly larger systems. The membrane was prepared in a superposition of two mechanical displacement states separated by approximately 5.2 pm, corresponding to an effective separation of ~10^12 times the membrane's zero-point motion.\n\nQuantum coherence was verified through three complementary approaches: (1) Ramsey interferometry to measure coherence times, (2) Wigner function tomography to directly visualize the quantum state in phase space, and (3) Bell-type measurements to confirm the non-classical nature of correlations between the membrane and a superconducting qubit.\n\nTo address potential loopholes in the interpretation of results, we implemented rigorous calibration procedures and control experiments. These included tests for classical resonance effects, thermal fluctuations, and environmental decoherence channels. Theoretical modeling incorporated both standard decoherence theory and modifications suggested by objective collapse models, particularly the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model with varying parameter values.\n\nResults:\nOur primary finding is the observation of quantum coherence in the macroscopic membrane with a measured coherence time of 372 ± 15 μs. The Wigner function reconstruction clearly revealed the negative regions characteristic of quantum states, with a maximum negative value of -0.27 ± 0.03, significantly below the classical threshold of zero. Bell-type measurements yielded a maximum CHSH parameter of 2.62 ± 0.14, exceeding the classical limit of 2 by more than 4 standard deviations.\n\nThe coherence time measurements across different superposition separation distances allowed us to extract the decoherence rate's scaling with size. Interestingly, the observed scaling follows a power law with an exponent of 1.73 ± 0.11, deviating from the quadratic scaling predicted by standard decoherence theory. This discrepancy suggests either the presence of unexpected decoherence mechanisms or potential modifications to the theoretical framework.\n\nWhen compared against predictions from objective collapse models, our results place stringent constraints on the CSL model parameters. Specifically, the measured coherence times are incompatible with the CSL collapse rate parameter λ exceeding 10^-11 s^-1, an order of magnitude lower than previous experimental bounds. However, our results remain consistent with gravitational decoherence models that incorporate modifications to quantum mechanics based on general relativistic considerations.\n\nWe also observed an unexpected temperature dependence of the coherence time, with a non-monotonic relationship peaking around 25 mK. This behavior is not fully explained by current theoretical models and suggests complex interactions between the quantum system and its thermal environment that warrant further investigation.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe demonstration of quantum coherence in a system containing approximately 10^18 atoms represents a significant advancement in probing the quantum-classical boundary. Our results challenge conventional wisdom regarding the size limits of quantum behavior and provide new experimental constraints on theoretical models of the quantum-to-classical transition.\n\nThe observed deviation from standard decoherence scaling laws is particularly intriguing. Several possible explanations exist, including: (1) previously uncharacterized decoherence channels specific to macroscopic systems, (2) modifications to quantum mechanics at larger scales, or (3) limitations in our current understanding of how complex systems interact with their environments. The consistency of our results with gravitational decoherence models lends support to theoretical approaches that incorporate gravitational effects into quantum mechanics, though alternative explanations cannot be ruled out.\n\nFrom a foundational perspective, our results contribute to the ongoing debate about the universality of quantum mechanics. While we have not observed any fundamental breakdown of quantum principles, the modified scaling behavior suggests that additional physical considerations may be necessary when applying quantum theory to increasingly macroscopic systems. This has implications for interpretations of quantum mechanics, particularly those that propose scale-dependent modifications.\n\nThe technological implications of our work are also significant. The demonstrated coherence times in macroscopic systems are approaching thresholds relevant for quantum information processing. This opens possibilities for quantum memory elements with substantially larger capacities than current implementations. Additionally, the hybrid opto-electromechanical approach we developed provides a new platform for quantum transduction between microwave and optical domains, addressing a key challenge in quantum network development.\n\nConclusion:\nThis study reports the observation of quantum coherence in a macroscopic system containing approximately 10^18 atoms, extending the demonstrated size range of quantum behavior by an order of magnitude. The results reveal unexpected scaling properties of decoherence mechanisms and place new constraints on theoretical models of the quantum-to-classical transition. While consistent with quantum mechanics as a universal theory, our findings suggest that additional physical considerations may be necessary when applying quantum principles to macroscopic systems. Beyond their fundamental significance, these results establish a new experimental platform for exploring quantum physics at unprecedented scales and may enable novel approaches to quantum technologies.\n    ",authors:[{id:"auth-10001",name:"Dr. Sophia Chen",institution:"Institute for Quantum Information Science, California Institute of Technology",email:"s.chen@caltech.edu",orcid:"0000-0002-8745-1392"},{id:"auth-10002",name:"Prof. Markus Schmidt",institution:"Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics",email:"m.schmidt@mpq.mpg.de",orcid:"0000-0001-9437-5284"},{id:"auth-10003",name:"Dr. Hiroshi Nakamura",institution:"Quantum Computing Research Center, RIKEN",email:"h.nakamura@riken.jp",orcid:"0000-0003-5162-7918"}],publishedDate:"2025-02-05",category:"Physics",keywords:["quantum coherence","macroscopic quantum effects","quantum-classical boundary","decoherence","quantum foundations","optomechanics"],citations:18,views:927,doi:"10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.050801"},{id:"phys-002",title:"Topological Phases in Non-Hermitian Photonic Systems: Experimental Realization and Characterization",abstract:"Non-Hermitian physics, which describes open quantum systems with gain and loss, has recently emerged as a powerful framework for understanding novel topological phases of matter.

These phases are characterized by robust boundary states and quantized bulk properties that remain invariant under continuous deformations of the system. While the study of topological phases initially focused on closed quantum systems described by Hermitian Hamiltonians, recent theoretical work has extended these concepts to open systems described by non-Hermitian operators, which incorporate gain and loss mechanisms (Bergholtz et al., 2021).\n\nNon-Hermitian systems exhibit several unique phenomena without Hermitian counterparts, including exceptional points (where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce), the non-Hermitian skin effect (where eigenstates localize at boundaries), and modified bulk-boundary correspondences. These features not only challenge our fundamental understanding of topological physics but also offer new opportunities for controlling wave propagation in practical applications.\n\nPhotonic systems provide an ideal platform for exploring non-Hermitian physics, as gain and loss can be readily implemented through optical amplification and absorption. This paper reports the experimental realization of a non-Hermitian photonic lattice that exhibits topological phases with properties fundamentally distinct from those in Hermitian systems. We demonstrate the existence of robust edge states protected by a generalized bulk-boundary correspondence and characterize the rich phase diagram of the system.\n\nMethods:\nOur experimental platform consists of a reconfigurable array of 24 evanescently coupled optical waveguides fabricated using femtosecond laser writing in a silica substrate. The waveguide array implements a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, which is a paradigmatic one-dimensional topological system. Non-Hermiticity is introduced through alternating regions of optical gain and loss, achieved by selectively doping regions of the substrate with Er^3+ ions (for optical gain) and Cr^3+ ions (for optical absorption).\n\nThe coupling strengths between adjacent waveguides are precisely controlled by adjusting their spatial separation during the fabrication process. By varying the ratio of intracell to intercell coupling strengths, we can tune the system through different topological phases. The gain and loss strengths are controlled by adjusting the pump laser power at wavelength 980 nm, which selectively excites the Er^3+ ions.\n\nTo characterize the system, we inject light at wavelength 1550 nm into individual waveguides and measure the output intensity distribution using an infrared camera. The complex eigenvalue spectrum is reconstructed through a combination of output intensity measurements and interferometric phase measurements. Edge states are identified by their spatial localization at the boundaries of the array and their propagation properties.\n\nWe systematically explore the phase diagram by varying three key parameters: (1) the ratio of intracell to intercell coupling strengths, (2) the strength of gain and loss, and (3) the degree of disorder introduced by randomly perturbing the waveguide positions. For each configuration, we measure the complex energy spectrum, the spatial distribution of eigenstates, and the dynamics of wave packets propagating through the system.\n\nResults:\nOur measurements reveal a rich phase diagram with several distinct topological phases. In the Hermitian limit (with gain and loss set to zero), we observe the conventional SSH model behavior: a topological phase with edge states when the intracell coupling is weaker than the intercell coupling, and a trivial phase without edge states in the opposite regime. As non-Hermiticity is introduced, the phase boundaries shift, and new phases emerge.\n\nAt moderate levels of non-Hermiticity, we observe a generalized bulk-boundary correspondence, where the number of edge states is determined by a winding number in the complex energy plane rather than the real energy gap. The measured winding numbers agree with theoretical predictions within experimental uncertainty (±0.07). Remarkably, we find regimes where robust edge states exist even when the conventional topological invariant would predict a trivial phase, confirming the distinct nature of non-Hermitian topology.\n\nAs the non-Hermiticity strength increases further, we observe exceptional points where pairs of eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. Beyond these exceptional points, the system enters a phase dominated by the non-Hermitian skin effect, where the majority of eigenstates become localized at one boundary of the system. In this regime, the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence breaks down entirely, and the system's response becomes extremely sensitive to boundary conditions.\n\nOur disorder studies reveal an intriguing interplay between topology and non-Hermiticity. Edge states in the non-Hermitian topological phase demonstrate remarkable robustness against certain types of disorder, persisting even with positional fluctuations of up to 15% of the inter-waveguide spacing. However, we find that disorder in the gain and loss distribution can drive the system through exceptional points, leading to qualitative changes in the topological properties. This suggests a novel mechanism for topological phase transitions induced by non-Hermitian disorder.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe experimental realization of non-Hermitian topological phases reported here confirms several theoretical predictions and reveals new phenomena at the intersection of topology and non-Hermiticity. Our results demonstrate that non-Hermitian systems support topological phases that are fundamentally distinct from their Hermitian counterparts, with modified bulk-boundary correspondences and unique localization properties.\n\nThe observed robustness of edge states against certain types of disorder, even in highly non-Hermitian regimes, is particularly significant for potential applications. This robustness suggests that non-Hermitian topological systems could provide advantages for designing wave-guiding structures that maintain protected transport in the presence of fabrication imperfections and environmental fluctuations.\n\nThe exceptional points observed in our system represent singularities in the parameter space where the system becomes highly sensitive to perturbations. This sensitivity could be harnessed for sensing applications, where small changes in the environment produce amplified responses in the system. Our measurements near exceptional points show response amplification factors exceeding 20 dB compared to Hermitian configurations, highlighting the potential for enhanced sensing capabilities.\n\nThe non-Hermitian skin effect observed at strong gain-loss contrasts represents a novel localization mechanism distinct from conventional Anderson localization or topological protection. This effect could be exploited for energy harvesting or signal amplification applications, where wave energy is automatically channeled toward specific regions of the system.\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, our results provide experimental validation for recent theoretical extensions of topological band theory to non-Hermitian systems. The observed breakdown of conventional bulk-boundary correspondence and the emergence of new topological invariants highlight the need for a more general framework to classify topological phases in open systems.\n\nConclusion:\nThis study reports the experimental realization and characterization of topological phases in a non-Hermitian photonic lattice. Our results demonstrate the existence of robust edge states protected by a generalized bulk-boundary correspondence and reveal a rich phase diagram featuring exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effects. These findings not only advance our fundamental understanding of topological physics in open systems but also suggest new approaches for controlling wave propagation in photonic devices. The unique properties of non-Hermitian topological systems, including enhanced sensitivity near exceptional points and novel localization mechanisms, offer promising avenues for applications in sensing, communication, and energy harvesting.\n    ",authors:[{id:"auth-11001",name:"Dr. Alexander Khanikaev",institution:"Photonics Initiative, Advanced Science Research Center, City University of New York",email:"a.khanikaev@asrc.cuny.edu",orcid:"0000-0002-8786-1120"},{id:"auth-11002",name:"Prof. Mikael C.

While conventional phases break spatial symmetries, recent theoretical work has proposed the possibility of phases that break time-translation symmetry, dubbed "time crystals" (Sacha & Zakrzewski, 2023). In particular, discrete time crystals (DTCs) emerge in periodically driven (Floquet) systems, where the system responds at a fraction of the driving frequency, thus breaking the discrete time-translation symmetry of the drive.\n\nThe concept of time crystals challenges conventional thermodynamic wisdom, as these systems evade heating and thermalization despite continuous driving. This apparent violation of ergodicity is resolved through many-body localization or prethermalization mechanisms, which prevent the system from absorbing energy from the drive. Time crystals not only represent a fundamental advance in our understanding of non-equilibrium quantum matter but also offer potential applications in precise timekeeping and quantum information processing.\n\nPrevious experimental work has reported signatures of time crystalline behavior in various platforms, including trapped ions, nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, and nuclear magnetic resonance systems. However, these implementations have been limited in size, controllability, or the ability to directly observe individual constituents. This paper reports the observation of discrete time crystals in a large-scale programmable quantum simulator composed of individually trapped Rydberg atoms, offering unprecedented control and measurement capabilities.\n\nMethods:\nOur experimental platform consists of a two-dimensional array of 218 neutral ^87Rb atoms individually trapped in optical tweezers. The atoms are arranged in a triangular lattice with programmable spacing, allowing us to precisely engineer the interaction strength between atoms. Each atom can be prepared in either the ground state |g⟩ or a highly excited Rydberg state |r⟩ with principal quantum number n=70, which exhibits strong van der Waals interactions with other Rydberg atoms.\n\nThe experimental sequence begins with initializing all atoms in the ground state |g⟩. We then apply a periodic Floquet driving protocol consisting of two alternating operations: (1) a global microwave pulse that rotates the atomic state by an angle θ around the x-axis of the Bloch sphere, and (2) evolution under a Hamiltonian with Rydberg-Rydberg interactions and a detuning term. The rotation angle θ is set to approximately π, with small deviations used to probe the stability of the time crystal.\n\nAfter applying the driving protocol for a variable number of periods, we measure the state of each atom using state-dependent fluorescence imaging, which allows us to determine whether each atom is in |g⟩ or |r⟩. From these measurements, we extract the period-averaged Rydberg state population, correlation functions between different sites, and the temporal Fourier spectrum of the dynamics.\n\nTo characterize the time crystal phase, we systematically vary several parameters: (1) the rotation angle θ, (2) the interaction strength controlled by the lattice spacing, (3) the detuning of the Rydberg state, and (4) the presence of spatial disorder in the detuning. For each parameter set, we measure the persistence of subharmonic oscillations and the system\'s response to perturbations.\n\nResults:\nOur primary observation is the emergence of robust period-doubling oscillations in the Rydberg state population. When the rotation angle is set to θ = π and interactions are sufficiently strong, the system oscillates with a period twice that of the driving period, maintaining this subharmonic response for over 100 driving cycles. The subharmonic peak in the Fourier spectrum has a width limited primarily by the finite duration of our experiment, indicating coherent oscillations.\n\nThe stability of these oscillations against perturbations provides strong evidence for the time crystal phase. When we intentionally deviate from the perfect π-pulse by setting θ = π ± ε, conventional Floquet theory predicts that the subharmonic response should be destroyed. However, we observe that the period-doubling persists for deviations up to |ε| ≈ 0.15 radians, with the oscillation frequency locked exactly at half the driving frequency throughout this range. This robustness against perturbations is a defining characteristic of the time crystal phase.\n\nSpatial correlations reveal the many-body nature of the time crystal. We observe that the correlation length grows with increasing interaction strength, reaching approximately 4-5 lattice sites at our strongest interaction settings. The correlation function exhibits a characteristic alternating pattern in time, with strong positive correlations between sites at even multiples of the driving period and negative correlations at odd multiples, confirming the period-doubled nature of the collective response.\n\nThe role of disorder in stabilizing the time crystal phase is particularly interesting. When we introduce random spatial variations in the detuning, the lifetime of the subharmonic oscillations increases significantly, extending beyond 150 driving periods for moderate disorder strengths. This observation supports theoretical predictions that disorder-induced many-body localization can prevent thermalization and stabilize the time crystal phase.\n\nWe also explore the phase diagram by varying the interaction strength and rotation angle. The data reveal a clear phase boundary separating the time crystal phase (characterized by persistent subharmonic oscillations) from a thermalizing phase (where oscillations decay rapidly). This boundary becomes sharper with increasing system size, suggesting a true phase transition in the thermodynamic limit.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe observation of discrete time crystals in our Rydberg atom quantum simulator provides strong experimental evidence for this novel phase of matter. The key signature—robust subharmonic oscillations that persist despite perturbations—is clearly demonstrated in our measurements. The many-body nature of this phenomenon is confirmed by the spatial correlations and the stabilizing effect of interactions.\n\nOur results align with theoretical predictions regarding the stability of the time crystal phase. The observed robustness against variations in the rotation angle θ is consistent with the concept of "rigidity," where the system\'s response remains locked at a subharmonic frequency despite perturbations to the drive. This rigidity distinguishes true time crystals from trivial subharmonic responses that would immediately track changes in the driving parameters.\n\nThe role of disorder in our system highlights the connection between time crystals and many-body localization. The enhanced stability observed with moderate disorder supports the theoretical understanding that many-body localization can prevent the system from absorbing energy and thermalizing, thus enabling the persistent breaking of time-translation symmetry. However, our observation that time crystalline behavior persists even with minimal disorder suggests that prethermalization mechanisms may also play a role in stabilizing the phase over intermediate timescales.\n\nFrom a quantum information perspective, the time crystal represents a form of coherence protected by many-body interactions. The persistent oscillations effectively store quantum information for extended periods despite continuous driving. This protection mechanism differs fundamentally from conventional quantum error correction and may offer complementary approaches for preserving quantum coherence.\n\nThe programmable nature of our platform opens possibilities for exploring more exotic time crystal phases. For instance, higher-order time crystals (with period-tripling or period-quadrupling) could be realized by engineering appropriate interaction patterns. Similarly, spatiotemporal crystals that break both spatial and temporal symmetries simultaneously could be investigated by programming specific lattice geometries.\n\nConclusion:\nThis study reports the observation of discrete time crystals in a programmable quantum simulator composed of 218 Rydberg atoms. The system exhibits robust subharmonic oscillations that persist for over 100 driving periods and remain stable against perturbations, providing compelling evidence for the time crystal phase. Our results validate theoretical predictions regarding this novel state of matter and demonstrate the capability of Rydberg atom arrays for exploring non-equilibrium quantum phases. Beyond their fundamental significance, these findings may inform the development of novel quantum technologies that exploit the unique coherence properties of time crystals.\n
